Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
    examples.

Answer - 

Loops : a loop is a programming tool that is used to repeat a set of instructions. iterate is a generic
        term that means "to repeat" in the context of loops. a loop will continue to iterate until a 
        specified condition, commonly known as a stopping condition, is met.

1. For loop : Repeates code until the condtion is false.
              syntax :
                    for(initial; condition; update){
                        // code
                    }

              example : 
                    for(let i=1; i<=10; i++){
                        console.log(i)
                    }      

2. While loop : Runs code as long as the condition is true.
                syntax:
                     while(condition){
                        // code
                     }

                example : 
                    let i=1
                    while(i<=5){
                        console.log(i)
                        i++
                    }

3. Do-while loop : Runs code at at least once, then continues if the condition is true.
                   syntax:
                       do{
                         // code
                       }while(condition)

                   example :
                        let i=1
                        do{
                            console.log(i)
                            i++
                        }while(i<=5)
